# <CLI-Deliveries>

### Built with Ruby

version: 3.2.0

## Assumptions

This CLI (command-line-interface) was built with the assumption that you as the user know how to open and use your terminal to execute programs and make files/folders executable through the terminal.

## how it works

CLI that pairs names with addresses based on their SS score and prints the names with their names first followed by their address in a nested array looking like this

```ruby
[SS,["name","address"]]
```

your addresses and names file must be added to this folder to work.
