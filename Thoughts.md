### PsuedoCode

This CLI should be able to take as arguments two files one with the input the the names for the drivers and the next argument the file containing the addresses. Then we need to sort each of the arrays into easier to work with data. This names will be moved into arrays of vowels and consonants checking which name has more vowels or consonants and putting them into their perspective place and sorting them by greatest to least. In doing this to the names we can now easily make use of our SS for the addresses to be delivered to. Now its time to sort through the addresses and move them into seperate arrays by the length of the addresses one array being odd the other even. We now have the data sorted in a way that makes doing the math for the SS easy for us. Next the methods for calculating our ss
need to be created working with vowels for even streets and working with consonants for odd streets. Even streets have the greatest chance of giving us the highest SS score so we will itterate through those first. Since we are working with evens and odds the bonus SS will be added to each one if the the name is also even or odd. Even streets with even names should give the highest SS. Until even addresses array is empty we will use that array first since odd addresses with odd names are the same as even addresses. Then odd names with odd addresses will be will done next after odd names are finished the program will finish off assigning the names to addresses in order they come.

### First

Write logic for taking in users input for names and put those names into an array

### Second

Write the logic to take in the address to be delivered to

### Fourth

Sort through array of addresses and determine which ones are even and odd and then move them to new arrays that include only odd and even addresses

### Third

Make Methods to determine the SS in a seperate file inside folder

### sixth

split the names array into two one being of vowels and on being of consonants based on checking which is greater the vowels or consonants and ones that are equal will be moved to vowels with the greater chance of exploiting the SS.
